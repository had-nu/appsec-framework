## Objectives and Expected Outcomes

To propose solutions aimed at improving Application Security (AppSec) through the integration of practices throughout the development lifecycle, with a focus on the identification, mitigation, and prevention of vulnerabilities.

### Specific Objectives

    1.  Assess the current maturity of application security practices within the organisation or development environment;
    
    2.  Identify and evaluate the key security vulnerabilities that arise at different stages of the software development lifecycle;
    
    3.  Assess the security tools and methodologies currently employed within the development process;

    4.  Design and recommend a strategy for the continuous integration of security practices throughout the development lifecycle;

    5.  Provide actionable recommendations for implementing a comprehensive security training and awareness programme for all participants involved in the development process;

    6.  Evaluate and measure the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

### Expected Outcomes

    1.  A detailed report identifying the maturity level of security practices, highlighting strengths and weaknesses, along with actionable recommendations for improvement;

    2.  A comprehensive inventory of identified vulnerabilities, organised by phase of the software development lifecycle, accompanied by an analysis of the implications associated with each vulnerability;

    3.  A critical evaluation of the current security tools and methodologies, assessing their strengths and weaknesses, and providing suggestions for optimisation or replacement where necessary;

    4.  A documented strategic plan for the continuous integration of security practices, presented as an Application Security Programme and Roadmap, which outlines implementation steps, timelines, and metrics for success;

    5.  A set of guidelines and a curriculum for a training programme aimed at enhancing security awareness among stakeholders, including an evaluation plan to measure the programme's effectiveness;

    6.  A validation report that includes performance metrics collected before and after the implementation of the proposed solutions, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing the overall security posture of applications.
