## Considerations on the Challenges and Importance of Application Security

Application Security (AppSec) has become a fundamental pillar in modern software development, permeating all aspects of the development life cycle and establishing itself as an indispensable component of an effective enterprise cybersecurity strategy.[[1]](#ref-1)

Security breaches in applications  can lead to severe consequences consequences, including the exfiltration of confidential data, reputational damage, and significant financial losses.[[2]](#ref-2) [[3]](#ref-3) Therefore, integrating security practices in the early stages of development is a crucial step towards ensuring the production of more reliable, resilient, and secure applications against cyberattacks. In the context of evolving cyber threats, this practice emphasizes embedding security measures throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC), moving away from traditional methodologies that often treated security as an afterthought.[[4](#ref-4)]

According to Veracode’s 2024 State of Software Security report, over 80% of applications contained unresolved security flaws, based on the most recent SAST, DAST, and SCA scans using Veracode. Of these, around 70% exhibited at least one vulnerability listed in the OWASP Top 10, and approximately 41% contained vulnerabilities featured in the CWE Top 25. Among these, over 50% were classified as high in severity.[[5]](#ref-5) [[6]](#ref-6))

Another study by Proofpoint, Cybersecurity: The 2023 Board Perspective, has highlighted growing concern among board members in the retail sector about the possibility of significant cyberattacks over the next two years. According to the findings, 73% of global board members feel their organizations are at risk of a material cyberattack. Retail, being a consumer-facing sector, also highlights reputational damage as a major concern due to its potential impact on customer trust.[[7]](#ref-7)

This concern is further supported by data from the 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), by Verizon, which analysed over 30,000 security incidents and more than 10,000 data breaches across 94 countries, highlighted a dramatic 180% increase in attacks that exploit vulnerabilities. This trend has been primarily driven by ransomware activities and other extortion tactics, which account for approximately one-third of all data breaches. The report also emphasises that the "human element" remains a critical factor, contributing to 68% of breaches.[[8]](#ref-8)

These statistics underscore not only the alarming prevalence of unresolved security vulnerabilities within applications but also the urgent need for organisations, particularly in the retail sector, to prioritise cybersecurity measures from the earliest stages of development. Proactively addressing vulnerabilities during the design phase can significantly reduce the risk of potential breaches, ultimately safeguarding organisational integrity and maintaining consumer confidence in an increasingly hostile cyber environment. By embedding security into the software development lifecycle, organisations can better anticipate threats and mitigate them before they escalate, ensuring a more resilient and trustworthy application landscape.

On the topic of increasing breach costs, the IBM's 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report reveals significant insights into the financial and operational impacts of data breaches, indicates that the average cost of a data breach has risen to US$4.88 million, reflecting a 10% increase compared to the previous year. Breaches involving compromised credentials account for 16% of all incidents, with an average cost of £4.81 million and a detection time of 292 days. Conversely, companies that used Zero Trust Architecture had an average breach cost of $3.58 million, significantly lower than those without such practices. These figures demonstrate that early investments in security can lead to notable financial savings in the event of a breach.[[9]](#ref-9)

Another key aspect of application security worth highlighting is that this discipline is heavily influenced by the individuals involved in the development process. In this context, security teams should be regarded as strategic partners in the development lifecycle. The expertise of these teams must be utilised to identify and assess security risks, as well as to define and implement appropriate control measures.[[10]](#ref-10)

A lack of adequate training, the absence of a programme that encourages security-minded behaviour, and failure to adhere to security policies can lead to human errors, such as the implementation of insecure code or poor management of sensitive data within organisations. Wherefore, fostering a culture of security awareness within development teams is crucial, as it empowers developers to proactively identify and mitigate risks, thereby strengthening overall application security.

According to Gartner, the implementation of Security Behaviour and Culture Programmes (SBCPs) has proven effective in mitigating the impact of employees' unsafe behaviours. Rather than solely focusing on raising awareness, promoting behavioural changes through the company’s culture presents a more promising approach to reducing cybersecurity risks. Organisations that adopt SBCPs have seen improved adherence to security controls by employees, a reduction in unsafe practices, and increased agility and efficiency in implementing security measures.[[11]](#ref-11)

By adopting a proactive stance in funding and adhering to application security projects, organizations can not only improve their security posture but also enhance operational efficiency. This approach facilitates faster time-to-market while maintaining strong defenses against cyber threats. [[?]]

Prioritizing security from the outset and mitigating vulnerabilities before they become real threats help protect the organization's reputation with customers and partners. It reinforces the commitment to cybersecurity and data protection, resulting in more secure and reliable software by the end of the process. [[?]]
