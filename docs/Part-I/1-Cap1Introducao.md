## Considerations on the Challenges and Importance of Application Security

Application Security (AppSec) has become a fundamental pillar in modern software development, permeating all aspects of the development life cycle and establishing itself as an indispensable component of an effective enterprise cybersecurity strategy. [[1]](#ref-1)

Security breaches in applications  can lead to severe consequences consequences, including the exfiltration of confidential data, reputational damage, and significant financial losses. [[2]](#ref-2) [[3]](#ref-3) Therefore, integrating security practices in the early stages of development is a crucial step towards ensuring the production of more reliable, resilient, and secure applications against cyberattacks.

According to Veracode’s 2023 State of Software Security report, over 74% of applications analysed revealed at least one security flaw during checks conducted in the past 12 months. Of these, around 69% exhibited at least one vulnerability listed in the OWASP Top 10, and approximately 56% contained vulnerabilities featured in the CWE Top 25. Among these, 19.2% were classified as critical in severity according to the CVSS ranking. [[4]]

A more recent study by Proofpoint (2023) has highlighted growing concern among board members in the retail sector about the possibility of significant cyberattacks over the next two years. [[5]]

This concern is further supported by data from the 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report by Verizon, which shows that nearly 90% of incidents recorded in the retail sector are related to social engineering and web application attacks. Additionally, 82% of successful breaches involved data stored in the cloud. [[6]]

These statistics underscore not only the vulnerability of organisations in the face of cyber threats but also the urgent need to integrate proactive security measures from the early stages of application development. Doing so can help strengthen user trust while also resulting in significant cost savings in the production and maintenance of applications. [[7]]

IBM's 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report highlights that organisations with high adoption of integrated security practices saved an average of $1.68 million compared to those with little or no adoption. [[8]] Meanwhile, Gartner's 2024 cybersecurity trends report predicts that by 2027, half of CISOs (Chief Information Security Officers) in large corporations will have implemented secure-by-design strategies to optimise the acceptance of control measures. [[9]]

By adopting a proactive stance in funding and adhering to Application Security projects, companies not only ensure continuous improvement of their security posture but also enhance the quality and reliability of their applications. [[10]] Mitigating vulnerabilities before they become real threats helps protect the organisation's reputation with clients and partners, reinforcing its commitment to cybersecurity, data protection, and the development of more secure and reliable software.
