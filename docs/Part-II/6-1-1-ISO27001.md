## 6.1.1 ISO/IEC 27001:2022 - Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection — Information security controls

ISO/IEC 27001 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continuously improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). In contrast, ISO/IEC 27002 serves as a supplementary guide, detailing how to implement the security controls listed in Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001. In other words, while ISO/IEC 27001 is the certifiable standard for organisations, ISO/IEC 27002 provides practical guidelines for implementing the necessary controls to meet ISO/IEC 27001 requirements.

The Control 8.25 from ISO/IEC 27002 guides organisations in embedding security considerations across all stages of the software development lifecycle, from planning through to deployment. This includes defining information security standards and applying these standards throughout the development process. As a preventative measure, this control requires organisations to design and implement rules and controls proactively to ensure software products and systems are secure by default.

In the field of Application Security, ISO/IEC 27034 extends security governance by specifically focusing on application security, a crucial aspect in today’s information security context. While ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 set out general information security practices and controls, ISO/IEC 27034 provides a framework focused on embedding security controls within the software development lifecycle.[[?](#ref-55)]

Documented procedures for organizational activities associated with information security should be prepared.     |
| 8.4        | Access to source code                          | Access to source code and associated items (e.g., designs, specifications, verification, and validation plans) and development tools (e.g., compilers, builders, integration tools, testing platforms, and environments) should be strictly controlled. Open-source or third-party code repositories should have limited write access while read access may be broadly available. |
| 8.9        | Configuration management                       | Configurations, including security settings for hardware, software, services, and networks, should be established, documented, implemented, monitored, and reviewed. Organizations should define and implement processes and tools to enforce defined configurations (including security configurations) throughout system lifecycles.                            |
| 8.18       | Use of privileged utility programs             | The use of utility programs that can override system and application controls should be restricted and strictly controlled to ensure that their use does not compromise system and application security controls.                                                                    |

| 8.28       | Secure Coding                                 | Emphasizes the need to follow secure coding guidelines for each programming language used, aiming to prevent security vulnerabilities in the source code of applications.                                                                                                             |
| 8.29       | Security Testing in Development and Acceptance | Highlights the importance of conducting security testing during development and acceptance phases to identify and address vulnerabilities before systems or applications go live.                                                                                                    |
| 8.30       | Outsourced Development                        | Ensures that outsourced development follows the organization's secure development rules and procedures, ensuring that external partners adopt compatible security practices.                                                                                                         |
| 8.31       | Separation of Development, Test and Production Environments | Emphasizes the importance of keeping development, testing, and production environments separate to reduce the risk of accidental or malicious impacts on production environments.                                                     |
