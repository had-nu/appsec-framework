# Application Security Framework (ASF)

## Context

*This repository is the outcome of my master's project aimed at creating an Application Security Framework for implementing a comprehensive strategy to integrate secure practices throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The project was developed in the context of the automotive retail sector, within a company with low security maturity.*

## Repository Purpose

*This repository houses the Application Security Program (ASP) within the Application Security Framework (ASF), outlining the vision, objectives, and strategies to ensure the development of secure, resilient applications. It combines policies, processes, practices, and tools designed to integrate security from the beginning of development to the end of the application lifecycle. These practices, alongside the security controls that drive them, help identify areas for improvement in application design or implementation that could potentially expose the application, the environment, or the company to significant risk.*

## Scope

*The scope of this proposal includes integrating security practices throughout the SDLC for all internally developed and externally acquired applications. It covers evaluating the maturity of current security practices, defining a target maturity profile, and creating an implementation strategy to promote security awareness, training, and adherence to policies across the organization continuously.*

*To be successful, the program must ensure security practices are embedded from the planning and analysis phase through design, coding, testing, and into deployment and maintenance. This includes adopting best security practices like Threat Modeling and Application Risk Analysis, as well as introducing technologies for automating and orchestrating security analysis tools (e.g., SAST, DAST, IAST), and continuously verifying code components and supply chains to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.*

## Audience

*Technology Managers, Executives, Product Owners, Development Teams, and Information Security Professionals.*
