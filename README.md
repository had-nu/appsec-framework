# Application Security Framework (ASF)

### Context

This repository is the final deliverable of my master's project, centered on developing an Application Security Framework (ASF). The goal is to establish a comprehensive strategy for embedding secure practices throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The project was implemented in the automotive retail sector, within an organization that demonstrated a low level of security maturity.

### Repository Purpose

This repository hosts the Application Security Program (ASP), part of the ASF, defining the vision, objectives, and strategies to ensure the development of secure, resilient applications by proactively addressing threats and minimizing vulnerabilities. It consolidates policies, processes, best practices, and tools aimed at embedding security throughout the entire application lifecycle. 

### Scope

The scope includes integrating security practices across the SDLC for both internally developed and third-party applications. This involves evaluating the maturity of existing security practices, defining a target security maturity level, and creating an implementation strategy that promotes a decentralized securty responsability sense, security training and culture building, and adherence to security policies throughout the organization.

### Success Criteia

To succeed, the program must ensure security practices are integrated from the planning and analysis phases, design, coding, testing, through the end of life. This includes implementing best practices as Threat Modeling and Application Risk Assessment, as well as introducing technologies for automating and orchestrating security testing tools (e.g., SAST, DAST, IAST). Additionally, the program must involve continuous verification of code components and supply chain dependencies to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities post-release.

### Audience

Technology Managers, Executives, Product Owners, Development Teams, and Information Security Professionals.
